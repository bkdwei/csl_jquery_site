The code on this repo was done utilizing localhost through XAMPP.
But a proper online view can be done through http://connacht-sl.netne.net

This is layed out using Codeigniter so the main html display code is on a view file
This View file is located in www/applications/views/csldisplay.php

Another View file in the same location called csl_view.php is used to display the JSON 
that is is retrieved via  a Controller file and Model file from a MySQL database.

There are two Controller files.The first called cslcontrol.php contains the functions
that are endpoints for the urls used in getJSON requests. Its functions take the requests
and turns them into instructions for the Model file. It then takes the Model files response
and assigns it to the csl_view.php where its encode and displayed as JSON.
(if you wish to view a JSON example from this go to http://connacht-sl.netne.net/index.php/cslcontrol/titleWin)

The second Controller called cslhome.php contains an index function that activates when the
user first requests the site and basically displays the main html view.

Both Controllers are located in www/applications/controllers/

The Model file cslmodel.php is located in  www/applications/models/ and takes instructions from
from the cslcontrol file as to which of its own functions should be used. each of these function
retreive data from a MySQL database.

The main Javascript file is located in www/js called csl.js. It cantains all the get JSON requests,
 all the jQuery load() requests and controls the hiding and displaying of the different div windows.
The other js file is the bootstrap one that controls all bootstrap features basic operation such as 
navbar and modal. 

The main css file is main-styles.css that as well as controlling unique divs also modifies custom 
Bootstrap css. Bootstrap css also here.

The jQuery library is accessed through a CDN at the moment.
