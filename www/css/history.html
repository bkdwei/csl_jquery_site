<p id="home_txt">This updated site remembers the Connacht Senior League, an intermediate league that ran between 1981 and 2000. It allowed clubs from the west of Ireland a chance to compete at Intermediate level and even get the oppurtunity to play in the FAI cup, also the League Cup when it had group stages. Sadly the league struggled to gain significant membership with the majority of clubs coming from Galway, resulting in applications accepted from Leinster based sides. However at a time when Irish soccer was going through a boom two divisions were created but this was too quickly dismissed and probably led to the decline in membership afterwards. Finances, travel and lost junior status were some of the issues facing clubs but there were highlights and progress that is worth remembering and thanks to research done primarilly through the Irish News Archive, these memories are presented on this website.</p>
<h4 id="hist_txt">Revolving door policy</h4>

<p id="hist_txt">The following season Ballinasloe Town joined, its unclear whether this increased Galway or Roscommon representation. Galway United sent a reserve side in '83 just to confuse visiting sides to Galway even more, many wondering if Galway Utd and Mervue could actually be seen in the same place at once. Luckily the '84 league was decided by a playoff between Mervue and Salthill (a Galway side that didnt play in maroon). It took 3 games to decide with Mervue winning and local papers praising the league while local papers elsewhere in the west praised road widening. Galway United marooned (enough already) themselves with the next 2 titles, the second coming after a playoff against UCG who also played in maro..(Okay I'll stop).</p>

<p id="hist_txt">The league was already experiencing drop-outs, in '86 Ballina Rovers left meaning Mayo had no representation, Castlerea left meaning that Roscommon had none, or had depending on Ballinasloe's confused state. Sligo Rovers had dropped out the year before but this did'nt affect the Sligo-Leitrim league representation as it never had nor never would have. This meant just 6 teams in 86-87, however the league's profile was boosted when Mervue beat Longford Town in the FAI cup proper before a Connacht senior selection beat both a Leinster senior and Munster selection in an inter-provincial series. This was the only series Connacht won and the use of mainly Galway players showed that all sports out west succeed on the same principle. Amazingly the Connacht senior selection then got invited to play in the League of Ireland cup, where they would play in a group with Galway United seniors, Limerick City and Newcastlewest for the next few seasons, maybe not so amazing.</p>

<h4 id="hist_txt">Late eighties and 'The only way is up(Baby!)'</h4>

<p>After the low turnout of 86-87 league membership started to increase with future champs Castlebar Celtic joining and the same year saw a club called Gentex FC join, with soccer nuts in Leitrim hoping that Gentex was that place near the village where the bypass was proposed. Gentex were from Athlone, Co.Westmeath but based west of the shannon, providing more Roscommon or not confusion (no wonder their politicians need a spliff). It did'nt matter really as Gentex got spanked in every game, pulling out before the seasons end. Other sides fared better with Westport and Ballina Town joining to increase Mayo's interest and remove it from all those embarrassing over-hyped All-Ireland efforts. Sligo Rovers also returned after 5 years and then Longford Town reserves signed up, also possibly claiming to be from Roscommon. Gentex for some sadistic reason rejoined, bringing along their Athlone neighbours St. Peters so to have a chance of picking up some points. Nope did'nt work, St. Peters spanked them as well.</p>

<p id="hist_txt">Membership increased to a level where 2 divisions were proposed. To decide who would go into what division, two divisions were created...! These were two groups with the top 3 to 4 sides going into a premiership, the rest to a first division with the actual group winners in a playoff for the title. Just to show how tough it would be Straide & Foxford United (thats one club) won it in their first season. After that the'95-96 season saw the premiership and first division take place. It was exciting stuff as UCG pipped S&F U (you know who it is) to the title, Galway and Salthill fighting to avoid relegation with Ballinasloe and Galway-hibernians estatic at being promoted from the first, great stuff. But whoosh..... like that it was gone, in '96-97 it was just one division again, It was almost like the two divisions never happened, Ballinasloe still look at that empty spot in their trophy cabinet thinking was'nt there a first division cup there?, no thats ridiculous, there never was a first division (RIGHT!!).</p>

<h5 id="hist_txt">Celtic Tiger me a%#e</h5>

<p id="hist_txt">After this came more drop-outs, the geographically confused Longford sides left, Gentex ditched their self-torture fetish and Ballinasloe concentrated on Junior football so that they could commit to just one county, which one were not sure. Even Straide & Foxford Utd left four years after winning the title (again thats one team, one title). Mervue won four titles in a row, well maybe one of them was Galway or UCG(ah come on its been a while), but it all ended when the leading sides (all the Galway teams, again!) decided to take part in an Eircom U21 league in 2000. This league was promoted by Brian Kerr before he became senior Ireland manager and people still actually took his advice, so the ambitious Galway sides 'marooned' (it wont stop) their Mayo and umm! Athlone counterparts (and their own over 21s) to make the Connacht senior league no more.</p>

<h1>Ballina Rovers</h1> <h2>- (1981-86)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">The first Mayo side to take part and a founder club. After a decent first season they regularly struggled in the league, usually finishing bottom and like Castlerea blamed off field problems for their departure. The proposed North-West league between Connacht and Ulster clubs was deemed to be a financial burden and Rovers pulled out before the idea got rejected. Ballina Rovers spent their time after this in the lower leagues of Mayo and in 1999 they were merged into Ballina Town.</p>
<h1>Ballina Town</h1> <h2> - (1989-00)</h2>
 <p class="text1 style17">Initially caused a stir by becoming the first (and only) Mayo side to take part in the FAI cup during their first season. Though beaten 4-0 by Shelbourne, Town played well against a side who would be League of Ireland champs within two years. After that initial flourish they had an unremarkable time in the league, usually finishing in the bottom 3 of the table with one exception being the 2 division season where they were 3rd in the first division but won the first division cup against that divisions winner Ballinasloe. They did also reach the Connacht Senior cup final in '93 and were narrowly beaten by league champs Mervue. When the Connacht senior cup was revived in 2007 their junior side made the final in 2010 but were well beaten by Salthill.</p> 
<h1>Ballinasloe Town</h1> <h2> - (1982-97)</h2>
 <p class="text1 style17">Club from the Roscommon & district league. Struggled in their first season but some improvement earned them a place In an 'Incentive cup' final where they beat Sligo Rovers. After this they usually finished in or around mid-table with the 2 group season seeing them miss out on a place in the next seasons premiership but they ended up becoming the only the first division title winners before the 2 divisions were scrapped. This decision could have led to their departure a year later in 1997.</div>
 <h1>Castlebar Celtic</h1> <h2> - (1987-00)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Joined in '87 having been one of the strongest junior sides for much of the eighties. Their arrival helped strengthen Mayo interest in the league and they made an immediate impact finishing runners-up in their first season and then winning the league in '89. With much of that eighties side retiring more title challenges were hard to come by but they did finish runners-up in 92, qualifying for the League of Ireland cup (as Sligo Rovers reserves were champions). Then during the 2 group season they managed to reach the title playoff final but lost to Mayo newcomers Straide &amp; Foxford Utd. A 1990 Shield success and Premiership  Cup victory in '97-98 however meant that they ended up being the most successful Mayo side. Left the League in 2000 just before it had been scrapped</p>
<h1>St. Peters Athlone</h1> <h2> - (1993-00)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">The second Athlone side to try their luck. Though they regularly finished near the bottom they had some success at the end of the era by winning the 'Millennium cup' thrashing Salthill Devon 3-0 in the final. They also made the Senior cup final but were beaten 4-2 by champions Mervue whom they'd knocked out of the Millenium Cup. Currently play in the Combined Counties Football League.</p>
<h1>Westport United</h1> <h2> - (1988-95)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Played in two cup finals in their first season and were the only side to beat neighbors Castlebar during that season. They made it to a Senior cup final in '91 losing narrowly to champs Salthill but after this they were usually in the bottom 3 to 4 clubs and after the 2 group season they pulled out. Another factor in them pulling out was being caught using borrowed players from Northern Irish clubs to help them in an FAI intermediate cup clash. The club suffered a fine and relegation in the Mayo leagues. However since the club won the revived Connacht Senior cup in 2009.</p>
<h1>Tuam Celtic</h1> <h2> - (1981-90)</h2> 
<p class="text1 style17"> Tuam played regularly during the eighties, struggled in their first season but improved in the second earning them a Incentive cup final appearance and victory over UCG. After this Tuam usually finished not too far from the bottom of the table, made numerous Incentive cup appearances but pulled out after finishing last in 1990.</p>
<h1>Castlerea Celtic</h1> <h2> - (1981-86)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Played in the first game involving Connacht Senior league clubs, a League cup tie where they got beaten by Mervue. They did well in their first league season being in the hunt for the first league and had they won at Sligo in their final match the Roscommon side could have forced a 3-way playoff between themselves Rovers and Mervue. After this they also made a number of League cup and Challenge cup finals but just were'nt strong enough at the end. Like Ballina Rovers they pulled out in 86 due to financial strain.</p>

<h1>Gentex FC</h1> <h2> - (1987-88 & 93-98)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">The first Athlone side to join the league were a club founded to represent the large 'Gentex' Corporation factory based in Athlone. Dropped out during their first season due to the release from Leinster not being correctly sanctioned. After 5 years they finally returned alongside neighbours St.Peters. Gentex managed only 3 victories during their time all occurring when they were in the First Division.</p>
<h1>Longford Town reserves</h1> <h2> - (1991-93 & 95-97)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Longford despite probably occasionally playing League of Ireland players struggled, finishing lower half in their first season and bottom the second. They dropped out but joined the first division after its creation in '95, finishing lower half and then finishing bottom when the league resumed as one division. On two occasions they depated before a season ended</p>
<h1>Galway Hibernians</h1> <h2> - (1994-96)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Galway Hibs were a strong junior club who'd won numerous Galway leagues and beat Mervue in the'87 Senior cup final. They finally joined in '94 for the 2 group season and made it to the Connacht Senior cup final where this time they lost to Mervue. Hibs had to settle for a place in the first division during the league split, they finished second earning a promotion but then pulled out leading to the decision to revert to one division</p>
<h1>Longford Celtic</h1> <h2> - (1995-96)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Joined during the two divisional season where they went into the first division. Finished bottom and were the only side to finish below Gentex. Left after this season.</p>
<h1>Manulla FC</h1> <h2> - (1997-98)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Became the sixth Mayo side to join but lasted just one season after finishing in the bottom 3. Had documented problems with some players unwilling to lose their Junior status for a season probably influencing the pullout.</p>
<h1>Mervue United</h1> <h2> - (1981-88 &amp; 91-00)</h2>
 <p class="text1 style17">The most successful club, their four titles in a row at the end of the leagues duration gave them over twice as many as their rivals. They won the first Connacht Senior trophy, the League cup, though failing to win that seasons league it was won 2 seasons in a row after this with the second involving two replays against Salthill. Alongside this they won the first four Challenge cups but this success was followed by bad league cup final defeats to Galway United and 3 Connacht senior cup final defeats to Junior opponents possibly influencing time out taken between 1989 and 91. On return they did a clean sweep of trophies in '93, won another Senior cup in '95, then suddenly dominated after the two divisions were scrapped in 96. They played in 6 FAI cup proper matches, including a 1-0 win over the Longford Town seniors in 87, a 1-1 draw away to Sligo Rovers seniors before losing the replay and later in that year (1998) Mervue got 2 draws in the League of Ireland Cup, a Connacht sides best showing. Their defection to the u 21 league meant the end for the Connacht Senior and since then they managed to play in the League of Ireland, being forced to depart due to Galways difficulty in keeping more than one League of Ireland club</p>
 <h1>Sligo Rovers Reserves</h1> <h2> - (1981-85, 90-98 & 99-00)</h2>
 <p class="text1 style17">Had played for a few seasons in the Sligo/Leitrim before becoming a founder member and winners of the very first Connacht Senior league and the senior cup. Rovers ended up being the only representation for the north east of the province but when the seniors went through demotion due to the league of Ireland split in the mid eighties the reserve side was withdrawn in 85. Sligo were prepared to join a North West league with Connacht and Ulster sides and after that died they attempted to join with the Ulster but the Connacht FA refused to release them. Sligo then returned and were soon back to winning ways winning titles in '92 and after another in '94 after a 3-1 playoff win over Galway United. In 96 they merged with Collegians but their form dwindled after this and left in 98 but did return a year later for the final season where they finished bottom of the league. </p> 
<h1>Galway United Reserves</h1> <h2> -(1983-00)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">Galway United posponed their arrival to the League but soon after joining were beating Mervue to the '85 title, beating UCG in a playoff for the '86 title and around this time also comfortably won league cup finals against Mervue. Another title followed in '88 but that was it as far as league titles were concerned though they did also beat '96 champs UCG in that years senior cup final. Despite their senior team going through tough times with relegation's, the Galway reserves stayed on till the end of the Senior League.</p>
<h1>UCG/NUIG</h1> <h2> -(1981-00)</h2>
<p class="text1 style17">One of two clubs to have a full unbroken run in the Senior League. UCG due to the college year started their season after after others and had to abstain from cup cometitions beginning in September. The students lost a title playoff to Galway in '86, a season where they also lost two cup finals, but finally won a title in 1990. During the 2 division split they became the premiership champions and had other cup successes in this time. They finished runners up to Mervue in the final three seasons but managed to beat them 7-1 in the'99 senior cup final. Like Mervue they also left to join the U-21 league</p>
<h1>Salthill Devon</h1> <h2> - (1981-00)</h2> 

<p class="text1 style17"> Had a full unbroken run in the league. Salthill won numerous Senior Cups, League cups, Challenge cups and one league title in '91. In their early seasons they were in the shout for a league title in '84 but lost a league playoff against Mervue that needed two replays. They were pipped in '89 before their title success came. They became the first club to represent the league in the League of Ireland cup in '91 as before this a Connacht Senior League selection took part and got to compete again in 94 as they finished 3rd behind the 2 reserve sides who were ineligible. Salthill didn't do a lot after this, if the 2 divisions hadn't been scrapped they'd have had a relegation,  also suffering a couple of cup final defeats. They did like Mervue end up in the League of Ireland but were forced to merge into SD Galway before being removed.</p>

<h1>Straide & Foxford Utd</h1> <h2> - (1994-99)</h2> 
<p class="text1 style17">They were separate sides till 1989 before merging meant they were winning Mayo league titles decided to sign up to the Senior league. They joined when the League was split in 2 groups and despite being in a group with tough Galway sides they made it to the playoff final beating the other group winners Castlebar Celtic 1-0. During the 2 divisional season they were premiership runners-up despite being unbeaten, then after the return to one division they were runners-up again. Unfortunately in '99 after the retirement of a few top players they finished in the bottom 3 and decided to drop out a season before the leagues demise.</p>
