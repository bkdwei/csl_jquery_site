  <div class="imagestuff"><div class="image"><img src="First-CSL.jpg"alt="CSL 81-82" width="240" height="130"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext style17">The first line-up for the Connacht Senior League, not a big line-up no but it couldn't  get any smaller. It unfortunately did</div>
 </center>
 </div>
 <p class="text1 style17">Seven clubs come together to take part in a new Connacht Senior League hoping to improve the standard of Connacht soccer and become competitive at Intermediate level. Mervue United  beat Sligo Rovers in the first trophy on offer, the League cup, a two legged round competition. Sligo however became inaugural champions thanks mainly by winning a penultimate game against Mervue 3-2 with two late goals before beating Castlerea Celtic in the final game. Castlerea had they won could have forced a 3-way playoff. Sligo also win the Senior Cup, a tournament also featuring Junior champs,  while Mervue manage to win the remaining trophy, the Connacht Challenge Cup which was a straight knock out cup for senior teams only. Other league sides include Salthill-Devon, Ballina Rovers, Tuam Celtic and UCG.</div>
 <h1>1982-83:</h1>
 <p class="text1 style17">Mervue United comfortably win title with Sligo Rovers runner up. Ballinasloe Town play their first season to bring the league to 8 clubs. An incentive cup is introduced where two sides without a trophy who show improvement from the previous season get to compete for a trophy, Tuam beat UCG  in the first one held.</p> 
<h1>1983-84:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="players.jpg" alt="players" width="240" height="270"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">Mervue(dark shirts) against Salthill. Why does one Mervue player have a sponsor on his shirt and the other does'nt? One guy put on a Galway United shirt by mistake, Hah!.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17">  Mervue United win league by beating Salthill Devon in a play-off as goal difference does'nt count. Play off required 2 replays with the first two games finishing 2-2 before the defending champs eventually won 3-0. A Connacht Senior league selection is asked to take on a Munster XI and narrowly lose 2-1. Galway United reserves joined the league to make it 9 teams.</p>
<h1>1984-85:</h1>
<p class="text1 style17">Galway United win the title ahead of Mervue who became the first CSL club to take part in the FAI cup proper, narrowly losing 2-1 to League of Ireland side and FAI cup holders UCD. League stays at 9 teams.</p>
<h1>1985-86:</h1> 
<p class="text1 style17">Galway United win the title by beating UCG in a playoff 4-3. Sligo Rovers became the first club to drop out and did'nt take part, cut backs due to relegation of their seniors after the League of Ireland split is the blame. Talks take place about setting up a North West league with Connacht senior clubs and Ulster clubs.</p>
<h1>1986-87:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="Untitled-2.jpg" alt="article" width="240" height="220"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">This one goes out to all those elitist rugby pundits, greedy Irish soccer captains and worthless Saturday night chat show hosts. </div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17">Mervue take a third title and Galway are runners up. League consisted of 6 teams after Ballina Rovers and Castlerea Celtic dropped out. The North West league idea was scrapped after an Ulster senior league was set up. A North West cup took place instead for one season but Connachts own fared poorly and Galway United were the only representative to win any ties though they were comfortably beaten by Derry City in the final. However Mervue United won their only FAI cup tie 1-0 against League of Ireland Division one side Longford Town but got knocked out by Munster senior side Rockmount in the next round. After this a Connacht Senior League selection beat both Munster and Leinster leagues in an Interprovincial series.</p>
<h1>1987-88:</h1> 
<p class="text1 style17">Castlebar Celtic are runners up to champions Galway United and they joined this season along with Gentex(of Athlone) to make it 8 teams. However Gentex are forced to pull out in early spring by the Leinster FA who did'nt sanction their release. Mervue lose 2-1 to Monaghan Utd in the FAI cup first round. The Connacht Senior League selection got to take part in the League of Ireland Cup, in a mid-west group with Galway United seniors, Limerick and Newcastlewest</p>
<h1>1988-89:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="88-89-final.jpg" alt="88-89" width="240" height="120"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">Standards were improving, I managed to find a copy of a league table, completed and error free.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17"> Castlebar Celtic are champions after a draw in their final game with second placed Salthill Devon is enough to clinch the title. The game was resheduled after an assault on the referee by a Salthill fan caused the original fixture to be abandoned with Castlebar leading 1-0. Westport United joined the league but Gentex failed to return. For the second season in a row Mervue lose a Connacht Senior cup replay to Sligo junior side Calry Bohemians. League cup was renamed the Shield.</p>
<h1>1989-90:</h1>
<p class="text1 style17">UCG win their first title and Salthill manage to take second spot. Ballina Town joined and also became the first (and only) Mayo side to play in the FAI cup losing 4-0 to Shelbourne. The Incentive cup changes format and features sides who are knocked out in the first round of the Challenge cup with Castlebar beating Westport on penalties in the final. Mervue United had dropped out while the Connacht FA stopped Sligo Rovers from joining the Ulster Senior League. The two parties came to an agreement and Sligo agreed to rejoin Connacht in the next season.</p>
