<div id="body">
<h1>1990-91:</h1>
  <div class="imagestuff"><div class="image"><img src="csl-91-92.jpg"alt="CSL 91-92" width="240" height="130"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext style17">Early nineties saw membership actually go into double figures. This is the 91-92 lineup.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
 <p class="text1 style17">Salthill Devon finally win the title and Sligo Rovers are runners-up. Rovers had just re-joined league but Tuam Celtic dropped out. Salthill Devon would represent the league in next seasons League of Ireland cup as it was decided to send champions instead of a league XI. For the first time the Connacht Senior Cup final features no Junior side as Salthill beat Westport 1-0.</div>
 <h1>1991-92:</h1>
 <p class="text1 style17">Sligo win the title by winning 2-1 at runners up Castlebar who will represent Connacht in the League of Ireland cup as Sligo's reserve side are ineligible. Mervue United re-joined this season and the Longford Town Reserves also joined.</p> 
<h1>1992-93:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="sligo-rovers.jpg" alt="players" width="240" height="180"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">The same year they won an FAI cup, Sligo Rovers took time to acknowledge the reserves.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17"> Mervue do a clean sweep winning the title and all 3 remaining trophies on offer. League stays at 10 teams. Before the start of the season Ballinasloe attempted to join the league of Ireland.</p>
<h1>1993-94:</h1>
<p class="text1 style17">Sligo Rovers are champions after beating Galway United 3-1 in a playoff. Salthill will be in the League of Ireland cup after finishing 3rd behind the 2 reserve sides. Gentex managed to rejoin the league and Athlone neighbours St. Peters joined them. Longford Town had pulled their team out while the Connacht Senior cup final featured 2 junior sides, one of those sides (Straide & Foxford United) will join the league next season. The Shield does not run this season.</p>
<h1>1994-95:</h1> 
<p class="text1 style17">Straide &amp; Foxford United win the title in their first season after a 1-0 playoff final against Castlebar. The league was split into 2 groups with the group winners meeting in the final. The top 3 sides in each group would go into a premiership the following season along with a playoff winner from one of the fourth place teams while the remaining sides would go into a first division. Galway Hibernians joined the league alongside the eventual champions. The Challenge cup was scrapped this season.</p>
<h1>1995-96:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="CSL-1995-96,2.jpg" alt="article" width="240" height="330"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">Two divisions!. Looks like the Connacht Senior League has finally established itself. The clubs and every one else involved  should be proud of themselves. Time to look forward.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17">UCG win the premiership with an unbeaten Straide &amp; Foxford Utd runners up while the division 1 title was won by Ballinasloe, with Galway Hibs finishing second. There is controversy as UCG get an equiliser in a vital game against Straide &amp; Foxford from a rebound that came off a back stansion and not the post as the referee believed. Division one saw Ballinasloe fielding ineligible players and escape a points deduction. Longford Town and Longford Celtic had joined the first division with Westport United not taking part. Both divisions consisted of 7 teams and a Premiership cup and First Division cup are introduced.</p>
<h1>1996-97:</h1> 
<p class="text1 style17">The two divisions are scrapped and the Senior League resumes as one division after Galway Hibs and Longford Celtic both dropped out. Mervue win the title as Straide &amp; Foxford Utd are runners up again. The Premiership cup is retained as a new knock out competition with UCG winning. A third Athlone club St. Marys attempted to join but reconsidered while Gentex pulled out before the seasons end yet again.</p>
<h1>1997-98:</h1>
<p class="text1 style17"> Mervue United win the title with NUIG (previously UCG) runners up. Manulla of Mayo joined and Gentex had returned after failing to finish the previous season but Ballinasloe and Longford Town dropped out. Mervue made a third appearance in the FAI cup taking Sligo Rovers senior side to a replay, they lost it 2-0 after getting a 1-1 draw at the Showgrounds. The Premiership Cup is reformatted as a League Cup/Shield style competition with Castlebar winning on this occasion</p>
<h1>1998-99:</h1>
<p class="text1 style17">Mervue win the title ahead of NUIG again. Manulla, Sligo Rovers and Gentex dropped out and league was back down to 8 teams as it was at the start of the decade. Mervue get 2 draws in the League of Ireland cup, a Connacht senior sides best performance in that competition but surprisingly suffer the worst defeat in the Senior cup final losing 7-1 to title rivals NUIG.</p>
<h1>1999-00:</h1>
<div class="imagestuff style17"><div class="image"><img src="csl-99-00.jpg" alt="88-89" width="240" height="120"; align="bottom" /></div>
 <center>
   <div class="imagetext">What the..!!!, this must be a league table from the eighties, surely, come-on.</div>
 </center>
 </div>
<p class="text1 style17">Yet again Mervue and NUIG finish first and second. Sligo Rovers rejoined after turning down an offer to join a National league 'B' league but Straide &amp; Foxford Utd had left. A new straight knock-out competition called the Millenium cup is introduced with St.Peters winning. That turns out to be that as during the following summer a decision to cease is taken. Mervue and NUIG had decided to concentrate on a new u-21 league (a Connacht/Ulster section) with Castlebar returning to junior football leaving the League without some of its most important members.</p>
