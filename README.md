# csl_jquery_site
The purpose of this Webapp is to demonstrate use of jquery ajax requests, also showing screen responsive coding, use of Bootstrap and use of PHP framework 'Codeigniters' web service capabilities. getJSON requests have been used to fill two large tables, fill a page with modal links, show GET request results on this modal and also fill a carousel with images. This JSON is created with the help of Codeigniter MVC, whose model graps relevant data from a MySQL database. The controller function that links to the model is part of the URL requested by getJSON, this controller also takes the database response and transfers it to csl_view which endodes it into JSON. To read the main html view, go to applications/views/csldisplay.php, the main javscript file is js/csl.js, main css is css/main-styles.css, the controller is under applications/controllers/cslcontrol.php while the model is under applications/models/cslmodel.php
